# The Remarkable True Life Story of Annie Besant (1847-1934)

FADE IN:

SYNOPSIS  
This is based on the remarkable true life story of Annie Besant (847–1934). A strong orator, energetic activist, and idealist, this Englishwoman mingled with the leading politicians and writers of her day. A modern woman, a pioneer of the feminist movement yet a deeply spiritual person.

The script follows her journey from a sheltered, religious life to one of activism and discovery. By chance, she stumbles into the mix of spiritualism, secularism, and socialism—becoming a well-known activist in the trade union movement and for women’s rights. In London, she was a friend of Oscar Wilde and other luminaries, and the lover of George Bernard Shaw. Ultimately, she turned from politics to join Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, later moving to India and even heading the Indian National Congress alongside Gandhi.

Funding is sought from England, India, Singapore, and the USA.

THE MANY LIVES OF ANNIE BESANT

EXT. PRISON YARD – 1867 – BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND  
It is 1867 in Birmingham. Prisoners are being loaded onto a windowless wagon drawn by horses.

    PRISON GUARD
  "OK, you can bring out the two special prisoners now."

The leaders of the Irish Republican Brotherhood are ushered out—standing proud and defiant—as they are forced into the wagon. A policeman climbs in with them while two others position themselves in front of the horses. The gates open and the wagon moves away.

EXT. STREET SCENE  
As the carriage rattles down the road, it enters a tunnel. A man halts the wagon with a pistol. A mob of over thirty men surges forward—climbing walls, firing into the air, and shooting a horse. The front-line policemen are dragged out and beaten; a terrified horse is shot, and the attackers desperately try to force open the locked door.

INT. PRISON WAGON  
Inside, a policeman peers through the keyhole—only to be shot through the eye and killed.

    POLICE SERGEANT
  "Ahh, Ahh"

    PRISONER 1 (FROM INSIDE)
  "Yer gone and shot the frikking policeman, yer silly bastards."

EXT. STREET  

    PRISONER 2
  "Bloody mad Irishmen! Hey, look. I can get the keys off this poor bastard."

He retrieves the keys from the fallen policeman, undoing the chain that binds them. Passing the keys through a ventilation grill, he hands them to a member of the mob.

EXT. STREET (CONT’D)  
The gang unlocks the wagon door, and the prisoners inside begin to jump out.

    RESCUER (IRISH ACCENT)
  "Which one of you are Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy? Come on—take these horses and ride like the wind."

Two men are helped onto waiting horses as the gang disperses, leaving an empty wagon, a dying horse, and a scene of chaos.

EXT. SAME LOCATION – ONE HOUR LATER  
The police clean up. The dead policeman’s body is removed as the police commissioner, a sergeant, and other officers survey the aftermath. A police constable runs up.

    POLICE CONSTABLE
  "Sir, we have recaptured four prisoners hiding in the park. They say it was a gang of Irishmen who tried to rescue the two leaders of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. I’m afraid those two escaped on horseback. The others claim they were uninvolved."

    POLICE COMMISSIONER
  "Well done, lad. Now, round up the rest."
  (to his Sergeant)
  "I suspected it was those micks. They’ll rue the day they think they can kill one of our men and slip away. Anyone with an Irish connection is a suspect."

FADE OUT.



EXT. LARGE ENGLISH PROTESTANT CHURCH  
The camera slowly moves toward a grand church as sunlight streams through its stained-glass windows.

INT. INSIDE THE CHURCH  
Inside, a small, solitary figure kneels in prayer. Seven- or eight-year-old ANNIE gazes upward in adoration of the statue of Jesus Christ.

    ANNIE
  "Oh Lord, please hear my prayers. I know my poppa is by your side now in Heaven. Please let him know I miss him ever so much. Also, keep Mama safe and help my brother Henry from sinning. Guide us each day and deliver us from evil. I am sorry you had to suffer to free us from mortal sin. I hope you love me as much as I love you. When I grow up, I promise to do your work on Earth—to fight for your cause and slay all your enemies. May God forgive those who have sinned against you."

(Her words echo softly, as if joined by a gentle male voice.)

INT. COURTROOM  
The scene shifts to a crowded courtroom. A young man, barely 19, sits in the dock as the judge’s gavel sounds with authority.

    JUDGE
  "May God forgive your sins. I hereby sentence you, William Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O’Brien, to hang by the neck until death. As you await your fate, remember the widow and child of the fallen policeman."

In the public gallery, 16-year-old Annie weeps, her eyes filled with sorrow and resolve.

    MANCHESTER MARTYRS (O.S.)
  "Free Ireland! Home rule for the Irish!"

EXT. THE COURT STEPS  
Outside, an angry crowd marches with banners reading “Free the Irish Patriots” and “Home Rule for Ireland.” The Roberts family struggles to exit amid the turmoil.

    ROBERTS
  "I didn’t expect such a harsh sentence. They’re political prisoners, not common criminals. Now, go home with my wife and daughters—I must tend to the others."

(He turns to a nearby Sergeant.)

  "Round up every man with an Irish accent. We’ll make an example of them."

INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM – INDIA  
In a modest, softly lit room, ANNIE sits by an open window while sounds of India filter in.

    VOICE OVER (ANNIE)
  "It was the summer of 1863 in Manchester that opened my eyes to injustice. The defiance in the face of oppression, the plight of the poor—all changed me forever."

INT. WILLIAM ROBERTS’ OFFICES  
Amid the bustle of a busy legal firm, ANNIE is swept along by Roberts.

    ROBERTS
  "Come on, Annie—follow me. It’s time you saw the world beyond these walls."

INT. MINERS’ HOUSE  
In a cramped, dim room, a MINER clutches his injured leg, despair plain on his face.

    MINER
  "I told them the brackets were faulty, Sir, but the foreman wouldn’t listen. Now me leg’s ruined and I have a wife and three kiddies to feed."

    ROBERTS
  "I’ll take your case to the colliery management. Don’t lose hope."

EXT. PUBLIC SCAFFOLD  
A grim tableau unfolds as three young men climb the steps to the scaffold. Three nooses await—a chilling reminder of justice’s finality.  
*(Note: Historically, only one died immediately; the others suffered a slower, more agonizing end.)*

INT. ANNIE’S HOME – EARLIER (EVENING)  
In a refined, middle-class home, the family gathers for dinner. An empty seat at the head of the table foreshadows change.

    MOTHER
  "Annie, Harry, stop playing. We must say grace before we eat. Dear Lord, bless this table and the food you’ve provided. Remember Papa in Heaven, and guide us all."

Annie clutches her mother’s hand, tears welling in her eyes.

INT. INFORMAL SCHOOL ROOM  
A spacious room with a baby grand piano, a chalkboard, and rows of attentive children. MISS MARRYAT, warm yet firm, addresses the class.

    MISS MARRYAT
  "At Fernhill, you must learn to think for yourselves—not merely parrot what I say. Raise your hands if you believe girls can be as smart as boys!"

Laughter and enthusiastic hand-raising fill the room.

INT. ANNIE’S NEW BEDROOM  
Annie unpacks with care. She pins up a poster of Joan of Arc, sets her Bible by the bed, and places a cherished photograph on her dresser.

MONTAGE – VARIOUS SCHOOL SCENES  
- Annie and Amy reading under a tree.  
- Music lessons with a gentle tutor.  
- Sports on a sunlit field.  
- A moment of silent prayer in a small chapel.

EXT. MS. MARRYAT’S GARDEN  
In a lush garden, 14-year-old ANNIE reads a newspaper.

    ANNIE
  "Auntie, have you heard? Charles Darwin’s just published *The Origin of Species.* According to this, we evolved from sea creatures over millions of years!"

    MISS MARRYAT
  "Yes—but never forget the Bible says man was created in God’s image. Would you trust divine truth or mere theories?"

FADE OUT.



INT. STUDY ROOM  
FRANK stands, somewhat taken aback, as ANNIE speaks earnestly.

    FRANK
  "Er, yes..."

    ANNIE
  "I believe Jesus has plans
