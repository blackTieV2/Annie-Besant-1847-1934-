# FADE IN:

## SYNOPSIS

This is based on the remarkable true life story of Annie Besant (847–1934). A strong orator, energetic activist, and idealist, this Englishwoman mingled with the leading politicians and writers of her day. A modern woman, a pioneer of the feminist movement yet a deeply spiritual person.

The script follows her journey from a sheltered, religious life to one of activism and discovery. By chance, she stumbles into the mix of spiritualism, secularism, and socialism—becoming a well-known activist in the trade union movement and for women’s rights. In London, she was a friend of Oscar Wilde and other luminaries, and the lover of George Bernard Shaw. Ultimately, she turned from politics to join Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, later moving to India and even heading the Indian National Congress alongside Gandhi.

*Funding is sought from England, India, Singapore, and the USA.*

## THE MANY LIVES OF ANNIE BESANT

### EXT. PRISON YARD – 1867 – BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND

It is 1867 in Birmingham. Prisoners are being loaded onto a windowless wagon drawn by horses.

<center>**PRISON GUARD**</center>  
> "OK, you can bring out the two special prisoners now."

The leaders of the Irish Republican Brotherhood are ushered out—standing proud and defiant—as they are forced into the wagon. A policeman climbs inside with the prisoners while two others secure positions in front of the horses. The gates open and the wagon moves.

---

### EXT. STREET SCENE

As the carriage rattles down the road, it enters a tunnel. A man halts the wagon with a pistol. A mob of over thirty men surges forward—climbing walls, firing into the air and at a horse. The front-line policemen are dragged out and beaten; a terrified horse is shot, and the attackers desperately try to force open the locked door.

---

### INT. PRISON WAGON

Inside, a policeman peers through the keyhole—only to be shot through the eye and killed.

<center>**POLICE SERGEANT**</center>  
> "Ahh, Ahh"

<center>**PRISONER 1 (FROM INSIDE)**</center>  
> "Yer gone and shot the frikking policeman, yer silly bastards."

---

### EXT. STREET

<center>**PRISONER 2**</center>  
> "Bloody mad Irishmen! Hey, look. I can get the keys off this poor bastard."

The prisoner retrieves the keys from the fallen man, undoing the chain that binds them. He passes the keys through a ventilation grill to a member of the mob.

---

### EXT. STREET (CONT'D)

The gang unlocks the wagon door, and the prisoners inside begin to jump out.

<center>**RESCUER (IRISH ACCENT)**</center>  
> "Which one of you are Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy? Come on—take these horses and ride like the wind."

Two men are helped onto waiting horses as the gang disperses, leaving an empty wagon, a dying horse, and a scene of chaos.

---

### EXT. SAME LOCATION – ONE HOUR LATER

The police clean up the scene. The dead policeman’s body is removed as the police commissioner, a sergeant, and other officers survey the aftermath. A police constable rushes forward.

<center>**POLICE CONSTABLE**</center>  
> "Sir, we have recaptured four prisoners hiding in the park. They say it was a gang of Irishmen who tried to rescue the two leaders of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. I’m afraid those two escaped on horseback. The others claim they were uninvolved."

<center>**POLICE COMMISSIONER**</center>  
> "Well done, lad. Now, round up the rest.  
> (to his Sergeant) I suspected it was those micks. They’ll rue the day they think they can kill one of our men and slip away. Everyone with any Irish connection is now a suspect."

# CONTINUED:

### EXT. LARGE ENGLISH PROTESTANT CHURCH

The camera slowly moves toward a grand church as sunlight streams through its stained glass windows.

### INT. INSIDE THE CHURCH

Inside, a small, solitary figure kneels in prayer. A 7- or 8-year-old Annie gazes upward in adoration at the figure of Jesus Christ.

<center>**ANNIE**</center>  
> "Oh Lord, please hear my prayers. I know my poppa is by your side now in Heaven. Please let him know I miss him ever so much. Also, keep Mama safe and help my brother Henry from sinning. Guide us each day and deliver us from evil. I am sorry you had to suffer to free us from mortal sin. I hope you love me as much as I love you. When I grow up, I promise to do your work on Earth—to fight for your cause and slay all your enemies. May God forgive those who have sinned against you."  
*(Her words echo softly, as if joined by a gentle male voice.)*

---

### INT. COURTROOM

The scene shifts to a crowded courtroom. A young man, barely 19, sits in the dock as the judge’s gavel sounds with authority.

<center>**JUDGE**</center>  
> "May God forgive your sins. I hereby sentence you, William Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O’Brien, to hang by the neck until death. As you await your fate, remember the widow and child of the fallen policeman."  

In the public gallery, a 16-year-old Annie weeps quietly, her eyes filled with sorrow and resolve.

<center>**MANCHESTER MARTYRS (O.S.)**</center>  
> "Free Ireland! Home rule for the Irish!"

---

### EXT. THE COURT STEPS

Outside, an angry crowd marches with banners reading “Free the Irish Patriots” and “Home Rule for Ireland.” The Roberts family struggles to exit amid the turmoil.

<center>**ROBERTS**</center>  
> "I didn’t expect such a harsh sentence. These men are political prisoners, not common criminals. Now, go home with my wife and daughters. I must tend to the others."  

*(He turns to a nearby Sergeant.)*  
> "Round up every man with an Irish accent. We’ll make an example of them."

---

### INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM – INDIA

In a modest, softly lit bedroom, Annie sits by an open window through which distant Indian sounds filter in.

<center>**VOICE OVER (ANNIE)**</center>  
> "It was the summer of 1863 in Manchester that opened my eyes to injustice. The defiance in the face of oppression, the plight of the poor—all changed me forever."

---

### INT. WILLIAM ROBERTS’ OFFICES

Amid the bustle of a busy legal office, Annie is swept along by Roberts.

<center>**ROBERTS**</center>  
> "Come on, Annie—follow me. It’s time you saw the world beyond these walls."

---

### INT. MINERS’ HOUSE

In a cramped, dim room, a miner clutches his injured leg. His despair is palpable.

<center>**MINER**</center>  
> "I told them the brackets were faulty, Sir, but the foreman wouldn’t listen. Now my leg’s ruined and I have a wife and three kiddies to feed."

<center>**ROBERTS**</center>  
> "I’ll take your case with the colliery management. Don’t lose hope."

---

### EXT. PUBLIC SCAFFOLD

A grim tableau unfolds as three young men climb the steps to the scaffold. Three nooses await them—a chilling reminder of justice’s finality.  
*Note: In reality, only one died immediately while the others suffered a slower, agonizing end.*

---

### INT. ANNEE’S HOME – EARLIER (EARLY EVENING)

In a refined middle-class home, the family gathers for dinner. An empty seat at the head of the table hints at impending change.

<center>**MOTHER**</center>  
> "Annie, Harry, stop playing. We must say grace before we eat. Dear Lord, bless this table and the food you’ve provided. Remember Papa in Heaven, and guide us all."  

Annie clutches her mother’s hand, tears welling in her eyes.

---

### INT. INFORMAL SCHOOL ROOM

A spacious room filled with a baby grand piano, a chalkboard, and rows of eager children. Miss Marryat, warm yet firm, addresses the class.

<center>**MISS MARRYAT**</center>  
> "At Fernhill, you must learn to think for yourselves—not merely repeat what I say. Raise your hands if you believe girls can be as smart as boys!"  

Laughter and enthusiastic hand-raising fill the room.

---

### INT. ANNIE’S NEW BEDROOM

Annie unpacks her suitcase with care. She pins up a poster of Joan of Arc, sets her Bible by the bed, and places a cherished family photograph on her dresser—a quiet testament to her disciplined nature.

---

### MONTAGE – VARIOUS SCENES AROUND SCHOOL

A series of brief shots:  
- Annie and Amy reading together under a tree.  
- Music lessons with a gentle tutor at a piano.  
- Energetic sports on a sunlit playground.  
- A moment of silent prayer in a quaint chapel.

---

### EXT. MS. MARRYAT’S GARDEN

In a lush garden, 14-year-old Annie reads aloud from a newspaper.

<center>**ANNIE**</center>  
> "Auntie, have you heard? Charles Darwin’s just published 'The Origin of Species.' According to the report, we evolved from sea creatures over millions of years!"

<center>**MISS MARRYAT**</center>  
> "Yes, but remember—the Bible tells us that man was created in God’s image. Would you trust divine truth or mere theories?"
