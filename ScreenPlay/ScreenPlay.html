         <span class="character">SYNOPSIS</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="action">This is based on the remarkable true life story of Annie Besant (847-1934) A strong orator, energetic activist and idealist, this Englishwoman mixed with the leading politicians and writers of her day. A modern women, a pioneer of the feminist movement yet a deeply spiritual person.     </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="action">The script covers her journey from a deeply religious and sheltered life to gaining awareness of the poverty and misery of the the poor. By chance, she stumbles into the then popular of spiritualism, secularism and socialism and becomes a well-known activist in the trade union movement and for women's rights. In London, she was a friend of Oscar Wilde  and other society people as well as the lover of George Bernard Shaw. But she never quite threw off her spiritual side and, at the height of her popularity, suddenly turned her back on political life and joined Madame Blavatsky, the notorious Russian who founded the Theosophical Society. Annie Besant eventually became President the Society and moved to India. She adopted Krishnamurti, who went on to become a world-renown teacher and philosopher. Annie returned eventually to politics and became the only white women to head the Indian National Congress where she fought alongside Gandhi for home rule.        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="action">This is the story of a woman who succeeded against the odds by her power with words and became a beacon for women who followed. Yet she was also a flawed character, lacking humour and misled by men. Right up to her old age she was still searching for a truth that always seem to eluded her but finds some reconciliation in her last  years.   </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="action">Our amazing tale takes us from England to America, India, Sri Lanka and Singapore as Annie pursues her passions. The story offers many opportunities in capturing life and scenes from the Victorian era, in London and the more exotic places. Apart from the roles offered to the three or four actors portraying Annie, there are many cameo performances which will excite actors.    </span>

It is where most young gentlemen start their education. I will be moving near to the school and will take in other boys as borders to bring in some extra money. I am afraid your dear father, bless his soul, did not provide for us well after his death. You, Annie, being a girl cannot go to Harrow or any private college as your uncle does not think girls need an education. However, through a friend I have found a place in Dorset where you can be educated. It is run by a Miss Marryat, a good Christian woman. who has agreed to take you without any fees.   </span>

It will be fun and you will have a friend to play with. </span>

But if you want inspiration to work, then walk down the squalid streets in the East End of London or the back streets of Manchester. If you are inspired by tenderness when you look at the wounds of Jesus who died in Judah years ago, but yet find not the same for the man and women dying in England today. I want you to hear the truth. Perhaps it is time for you to get off your knees and march for compassion. Use you voices to draw attention to the suffering of others.

         <span class="dialogue">When I was asked to give a lecture in this hall, I hesitated a little what to select for the subject of it. Various reasons seemed to restrict my choice to some political theme but even with this restriction the field was a wide one. But it happens to be my first lecture in a public hall, and a feeling of loyalty to my own sex made me determine that my first speech should be dedicated to the assertion of its rights; and I, therefore, chose as my subject "The political Status of Women". I am anxious that it should be clearly understood that I do not stand here as the representative of any society nor am I even a member of any; therefore any blame may be found in what I say , that blame should be leveled at myself alone., and not at the cause for which I plead. I plan to cover the following areas:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="dialogue">Why should the political incompetency of women receive so much attention when more pressing wrongs require a remedy?</span>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="dialogue">Political power would draw them away from the home and me a source of domestic annoyance. Lastly we are told that women are commanded by the Bible to keep silent and be generally as unobtrusive as possible. Every great truth, it has been said, must travel though three stages of public opinion: men will say of it, first, that it is not true. Second that it is contrary to religion and lastly that everyone knew it already. The rights of man have been battled through the first two stages. Every one know men have rights. These are natural rights. Kings presidents, governments draw their authority from the will of the people. It is quite a new light to the general public that women have any rights at all. Duties, ay, they have plenty of those. Wrongs, plenty of those too, which will not be borne much longer.. Privileges? Only granted at the hands of our masters. But 'rights'?  The assertion was first met with laughter. Only now are they taking this more seriously when they see we are in earnest. , and they condescend to use little argument, and to administer a little "soothing syrup" to these fractious children.....   </span>

Each extra mouth to feed, means less for the others. Unless we women use birth control, we are little better than the animals in the farmyard producing litters for the farmers to sell. This booklet 'Population' gives you the knowledge to prevent unwanted pregnancies.You can buy a copy at the back of this hall. You can regain power over your own bodies. Ladies, we have a a long way to go. We must press forward. Not only should we have control over our bodies, but we must demand equal rights for women, the right to have an education for ourselves and all our children. the right to keep what we earn, and the right to vote for instance. Surely , we should have the right to choose the people who govern us.      </span>

Bernard Shaw was frightened off by my detailed demands on what was required of him before we lived as man and wife. Looking back, I was probably far too serious for him. I eventually saw through Edward Aveling and ended that relationship. He then seduced poor Evelyn Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx. She eventually killed herself. Meanwhile I was working with William Stead on a new journal called The Link. It was was an article I wrote for Stead made me the darling of the trade union movement       </span>

These workers are also parents so a regular fair wage eventually benefits the children and us. And as I said, we cannot expect these children to focus on studies when they spend the day hungry. Let our school board lead the country by ensuring each London child has a meal provided by us. One nourishing meal as day, at least in their little stomachs. Do we all agree?       </span>

Madam Blavatsky is popular with society people. She is accomplished, I am told, at channeling spirits. What else... Some say she is a Russian spy ..oh yes she is one of the founders of the Theosophical Society. She and an American Colonel Olcott and another fellow set it up in the States some years back, now they are established here and India. From what I have read it is some kind of new religion.

She is a remarkable woman. In fact I am basing a character in my play XXXX  on her. Of course, she will never recognise herself. She is always to busy for self-reflection.   </span>

         <span class="dialogue">You know Annie , Helena and I were very close. Good chums, nothing more. We actually had nicknames for each other. I was Maloney and she was Mulligan. Do you know how we met? I had left the army, served the Government as a civilian adviser, but I was interested in the occult. It was the rage in America at that time. I went down to a farm in Vermont to investigate three children who attracted spirit visitors. Madam Blavatsky was there, also drawn by curiosity, I think. We hit it off. We made a odd pair. She was already overweight, untidy and laughed like a man. I was a reserved and disciplined army man. A rather sad widower, I guess.  She had a great sense of humour and cheered me up. I followed her around while she was writing and holding seances. We eventually were drawn to India and felt this was a very spiritual land. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="dialogue">You know, Annie, she wrote to me about you. In her last few letters it was obvious she had grown fond of you but more than that... she wanted you to lead the Theosophical Society eventually.        </span>

Helena did have clairvoyant powers but she wasn't above inventing things if she felt that was what was needed to get attention or create faith. She admitted it. I think she even showed you documents claiming she cheated and dared you to disbelieve. She didn't take herself as seriously as others. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="dialogue">Many things she had invented early in her life but wasn't allowed to let it drop. But she saw that it was not Koot Hoomi and the others which were needed to take the Theosophical Society to the next stage but YOU my dear, that down- to-earth, practical dynamo. The Masters will guide you. You are a great organiser which is why you became her right-hand man. Channeling and seances are no longer fashionable. Theosophy has to adapt now we are in the 20th century. We need to show the world how close each religion really is. Science is opening up much that was unknown but we are to explore the deeper mysteries of the soul.        </span>

But it is becoming increasingly clear to me that unless political action is taken, India's silk and cotton trade will be lost to the colonial masters. I see British textiles in our markets, not India cloth. You Indians are barred from certain jobs and organisations by the British. Years, back back in London, I spoke of the need to give India home rule. I believe it is now time for Indians to push for this change. If you are to feel the pride in your nation then you must govern yourselves. Your fight is my fight. Let us make 1913, a year that marks the beginning of the struggle. Who can we get in to work with us. Can we come together on this, across politics, religions and castes?   </span>

         <span class="dialogue">Sometimes, Annie, I think you expect too much of him. He is a simple young man who hates pomp and ceremony. He wrote to me that he was very uncomfortable during the trip to Australia where you took him to Charles Leadbeater. He and Wedgewood have ordained themselves as Bishops of the Liberal Catholic Church. He was very unhappy seeing all the gowns and colourful ceremonies. And you must be careful, yourself, the Theosophists are very much against this association of their President and this rebel Church. And I hear Leadbeater is also facing more accusations of behaving inappropriately  with young boys. Annie, as your friend, I ask you not to push Jiddu. If you are right, he will come to it in his own time. We need to worry about these painful attacks, maybe he needs to see a doctor. His brother Nitya's lungs are getting worse, I fear. The dry air here is helping but I fear he will not be long on this plane.     </span>

I know Jiddu is destined to lead  mankind spiritually, I just get a little impatient with him. He seems so dreamy at times, Emily, you know I am a person of action. I set up the Order of the Star as his own movement. He talks so beautifully to the young men and women who all adore him, but he seems unwilling to assume the mantle of leadership. Anyway, help me up and let me go and see the poor boy. How is that husband of yours? I see the name Edwin Lutyens often cited as the finest architect alive today. The Indian nation will remember him with gratitude  this current project in creating whole city..what's it called..er New Delhi.          </span>

         <span class="dialogue">My dear Teddy, I do hope you project for the Vice Royal's home and the plans for the new city in India are progressing well. I am sure you have designed a legacy for yourself and India.  I am proud to have such a talented husband. Annie is proving stubborn as usual. She will hear no bad word about that dreadful man Leadbeater. He is facing criminal investigations now and I can tell you many of the senior Theosophists are angry and feel this will reflect badly on the Society. Annie is such a bad judge of men. Look at that seducer Aveling in London, who borrowed money from everyone. Bernard Shaw just played with her and then later attacked her. As you know I am very close to Jiddu Krishnamurti, almost the mother  he never had, and he confides in me. He was disgusted with what he saw in Australia and I fear he is already slowly moving away from this role Annie sees for him. I am torn. It will break her heart but I also see a young man who has had his life mapped our by other and not allowed to develop normally. He does what he is told but I fear a break will come in not too many years. Currently he is worried about his brother who is dying of tuberculosis. This stress and his denial of the role of World Leader is behind his frequent painful attacks that force him to go to bed. I do my best, to keep them both happy but it wears me out sometimes. Do take care of your health on these frequent visits to India. I am afraid it is all too easy to catch disease there.  I look forward to our reunion, all my love, Emily.          </span>

I have not been persuaded to it by anyone. I am not persuaded in such things. For two years I have been thinking about this, slowly, carefully, patiently, and I have now decided to disband the Order, as I happen to be its Head. You can form other organisations and expect someone else. With that I am not concerned, nor with creating new cages, new decoration for those cages. My only concern is to set men absolutely, unconditionally free.   </span>

Jiddu denies this and still speaks fondly of him. Krishna still loves me, I can see,  but he is determined to go his own way. I am disappointed, of course. but as I get older, I am more accepting. Did I make a mistake, thinking he was the chosen one, the new World Leader?.... But my  own children, dear Mabel joined my Society and Digby has grown closer to me in recent years, This has been a great comfort.  A fall down the stairs in my office ended my traveling days. And I find it harder to remember my speeches. Its funny how the early years remain fresh in the mind. I once wrote that on my tombstone I would like the words "She sought after the truth". Well, as a Hindu I wish to be cremated and there will be no grave. You know, in my reincarnation, I hope I can find more peace. This life was a struggle and I was always seeking more. Bernard Shaw always told me I took life too seriously. I think maybe he was right. I didn't find the Truth but I hope I have been useful...I feel I have led many lives while still in this one mortal body.      </span>

She had written and spoken eloquently on independent governance for the India while still in London and was a major force in the movement in India years before Gandhi came on the scene. She founded many schools, supported women's rights and promoted both Hinduism and Buddhism, urging Indians to take a pride in their culture. In the West, however, she is largely forgotten. Other people have instead become associated with her pioneering efforts in women's rights, birth control, sex education. Her speeches and campaigns on Home Rule for Ireland and Trade Unions and her success in introducing free school meals and medical services for pupils are not remembered. Had Annie Besant gone into English politics, she would have probably been the first woman Cabinet Minister. She also found time to become a Freemason in Europe becoming the Grand Master in Co-masonry in England. A fine orator, an indomitable organiser and a truly remarkable woman.              </span>
